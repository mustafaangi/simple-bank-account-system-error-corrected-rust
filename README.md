# Rust Banking System

A simple Rust-based banking system that demonstrates fundamental concepts such as traits, structs, and error handling. This project allows users to perform basic banking operations like depositing and withdrawing money from bank accounts while handling potential errors gracefully.

## Features

- **Account Trait:** Defines the blueprint for banking operations such as deposit and withdraw.
- **BankAccount Struct:** Implements the `Account` trait with fields for account number, holder name, and balance.
- **Error Handling:** Utilizes Rust's `Result` type to handle errors in deposit and withdrawal operations.
- **User-Friendly Output:** Provides informative messages based on the success or failure of transactions.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust:** Ensure that Rust is installed on your system. If not, you can install it using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mustafaangi/simple-bank-account-system-error-corrected-rust.git
   cd rust-banking-system
